# US BikeShare Data Project
## Programming for Data Science with Python


### Description
Python was used to create an interactive user experience to explore some bike share data from three US cities- Chicago, New York City and Washington. The User is prompted to select a city then statistics are generated by day, month or all data based on the user's choice. A user may also choose to see the raw data in small segments.


### Files used
Bikeshare.py was created to compute the statistics
The bike share data sets are provided in separate csv files per city:
  -chicago.csv
  -new_york_city.csv
  -washingtom.csv
