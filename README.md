# US BikeShare Data Project
## Programming for Data Science with Python


### Description
Python was used to create an interactive user experience to explore some bike share data from three US cities- Chicago, New York City and Washington. The User is prompted to select a city then statistics are generated by day, month or all data based on the user's choice. A user may also choose to see the raw data in small segments.

Statistics generated:
#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
•	most common month
•	most common day of week
•	most common hour of day
#2 Popular stations and trip
•	most common start station
•	most common end station
•	most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
#3 Trip duration
•	total travel time
•	average travel time
#4 User info
•	counts of each user type
•	counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
•	earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)


### Files used
Bikeshare.py was created to compute the statistics
The bike share data sets are provided in separate csv files per city:
  -chicago.csv
  -new_york_city.csv
  -washingtom.csv
